# 1.6. An Overview of Unix Kernels

Unix kernels provide an **execution environment** in which applications may run. Therefore, the kernel
must implement a set of **services** and corresponding **interfaces**. Applications use those **interfaces** and
do not usually interact directly with **hardware resources**.



# 1.6.1. The Process/Kernel Model

When a program is executed in **User Mode**, it cannot directly access the **kernel data structures** or the
**kernel programs**. When an application executes in **Kernel Mode**, however, these restrictions no
longer apply. Each CPU model provides special **instructions** to switch from **User Mode** to **Kernel Mode**
and vice versa. A program usually executes in User Mode and switches to Kernel Mode only when
requesting a service provided by the kernel. When the kernel has satisfied the program's request, it
puts the program back in **User Mode**.

Processes are dynamic entities that usually have a limited life span within the system. The task of
creating, eliminating, and synchronizing the existing processes is delegated to a group of routines in
the kernel.

**The kernel itself is not a process but a process manager**. The process/kernel model assumes that
processes that require a **kernel service** use specific programming constructs called **system calls** .
Each **system call** sets up the group of parameters that identifies the **process request** and then
executes the hardware-dependent CPU **instruction** to switch from **User Mode** to **Kernel Mode**.

Besides user processes, Unix systems include a few **privileged processes** called **kernel threads** with
the following characteristics:

- They run in Kernel Mode in the kernel address space.
- They do not interact with users, and thus do not require terminal devices.
- They are usually created during system startup and remain alive until the system is shut down.

On a uniprocessor system, only one process is running at a time, and it may run either in User or in Kernel Mode. If it runs in **Kernel Mode**, the processor is executing some **kernel routine**. Figure 1-2 illustrates examples of transitions between User and Kernel Mode. Process 1 in **User Mode** issues a **system call**, after which the process switches to **Kernel Mode**, and the **system call** is serviced. Process 1 then resumes execution in **User Mode** until a **timer interrupt** occurs, and the **scheduler** is activated in **Kernel Mode**. A **process switch** takes place, and Process 2 starts its execution in **User Mode** until a hardware device raises an interrupt. As a consequence of the interrupt, Process 2 switches to **Kernel Mode** and services the interrupt.

**Unix kernels** do much more than handle **system calls**; in fact, **kernel routines** can be activated in
several ways:

- A process invokes a **system call**.
- The CPU executing the process signals an **exception**, which is an unusual condition such as an
  invalid instruction. The kernel handles the exception on behalf of the process that caused it.
- A peripheral device issues an **interrupt signal** to the CPU to notify it of an event such as a
  request for attention, a status change, or the completion of an I/O operation. Each **interrupt
  signal** is dealt by a kernel program called an **interrupt handler**. Because peripheral devices
  operate asynchronously with respect to the CPU, interrupts occur at unpredictable times.
- A **kernel thread** is executed. Because it runs in Kernel Mode, the corresponding program must
  be considered part of the kernel.



# 1.6.2. Process Implementation

To let the kernel manage processes, each process is represented by a *process descriptor* that
includes information about the current state of the process.

When the kernel stops the execution of a process, it saves the current contents of several processor
registers in the process descriptor. These include:

- The program counter (PC) and stack pointer (SP) registers
- The general purpose registers
- The floating point registers
- The processor control registers (Processor Status Word) containing information about the CPU
  state
- The memory management registers used to keep track of the RAM accessed by the process

> - [Stack register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register)
> - [Processor register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register)

When the kernel decides to resume executing a process, it uses the proper **process descriptor fields**
to load the CPU registers. Because the stored value of the **program counter** points to the instruction
following the last instruction executed, the process resumes execution at the point where it was
stopped.

When a process is not executing on the CPU, it is waiting for some event. Unix kernels distinguish many **wait states**, which are usually implemented by **queues of process descriptors** ; each (possibly
empty) queue corresponds to the set of processes waiting for a specific event.



# 1.6.3. Reentrant Kernels

All Unix kernels are *reentrant*. This means that several processes may be executing in **Kernel Mode**
at the same time. Of course, on uniprocessor systems, only one process can progress, but many can
be blocked in **Kernel Mode** when waiting for the CPU or the completion of some I/O operation. For
instance, after issuing a read to a disk on behalf of a process, the kernel lets the **disk controller**
handle it and resumes executing other processes. An **interrupt** notifies the kernel when the device
has satisfied the read, so the former process can resume the execution.

One way to provide **reentrancy** is to write functions so that they modify only **local variables** and do
not alter **global data structures**. Such functions are called *reentrant functions* . But a **reentrant
kernel** is not limited only to such **reentrant functions** (although that is how some **real-time kernels**
are implemented). Instead, the kernel can include **nonreentrant functions** and use **locking
mechanisms** to ensure that only one process can execute a **nonreentrant function** at a time.

If a **hardware interrupt** occurs, a **reentrant kernel** is able to suspend the current running process
even if that process is in **Kernel Mode**. This capability is very important, because it improves the
throughput of the **device controllers** that issue interrupts. Once a device has issued an interrupt, it
waits until the **CPU** **acknowledges** it. If the kernel is able to answer quickly, the **device controller** will
be able to perform other tasks while the CPU handles the interrupt.

Now let's look at **kernel reentrancy** and its impact on the organization of the kernel. A *kernel control
path* denotes the sequence of instructions executed by the kernel to handle a **system call**, an
**exception**, or an **interrupt**.

In the simplest case, the CPU executes a **kernel control path** sequentially from the first instruction to
the last. When one of the following events occurs, however, the CPU interleaves the kernel control
paths :

- A process executing in User Mode invokes a **system call**, and the corresponding **kernel control
  path** verifies that the request cannot be satisfied immediately; it then invokes the **scheduler** to
  select a new process to run. As a result, a **process switch** occurs. The first **kernel control path** is
  left unfinished, and the CPU resumes the execution of some other **kernel control path**. In this
  case, the two **control paths** are executed on behalf of two different processes.
- The CPU detects an exception for example, access to a page not present in RAM while running a
  **kernel control path**. The first control path is suspended, and the CPU starts the execution of a
  suitable procedure. In our example, this type of procedure can allocate a new page for the
  process and read its contents from disk. When the procedure terminates, the first control path
  can be resumed. In this case, the two control paths are executed on behalf of the same
  process.
- A hardware interrupt occurs while the CPU is running a kernel control path with the interrupts
  enabled. The first kernel control path is left unfinished, and the CPU starts processing another
  kernel control path to handle the interrupt. The first kernel control path resumes when the
  interrupt handler terminates. In this case, the two kernel control paths run in the execution
  context of the same process, and the total system CPU time is accounted to it. However, the
  interrupt handler doesn't necessarily operate on behalf of the process.
- An interrupt occurs while the CPU is running with kernel preemption enabled, and a higher
  priority process is runnable. In this case, the first kernel control path is left unfinished, and the
  CPU resumes executing another kernel control path on behalf of the higher priority process.
  This occurs only if the kernel has been compiled with kernel preemption support.
