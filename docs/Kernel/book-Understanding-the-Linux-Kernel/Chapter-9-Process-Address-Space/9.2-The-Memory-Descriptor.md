# 9.2. The Memory Descriptor

All information related to the process address space is included in an object called the *memory descriptor* of type  `mm_struct` . This object is referenced by the  `mm` field of the **process descriptor**. The fields of a **memory descriptor** are listed in Table 9-2.

Table 9-2. The fields of the memory descriptor





All **memory descriptors** are stored in a doubly linked list. Each **descriptor** stores the address of the adjacent list items in the  `mmlist` field. The first element of the list is the  `mmlist` field of  `init_mm` , the memory descriptor used by process 0 in the initialization phase. The list is protected against concurrent accesses in multiprocessor systems by the  `mmlist_lock` spin lock.

The  `mm_users` field stores the number of **lightweight processes** that share the  `mm_struct` data structure (see the section "The `clone( )`, `fork( )`, and `vfork( )` System Calls" in Chapter 3). The `mm_count` field is the main usage counter of the **memory descriptor;** all "users" in  `mm_users` count as one unit in  `mm_count` . Every time the  `mm_count` field is decreased, the kernel checks whether it becomes zero; if so, the **memory descriptor** is deallocated because it is no longer in use.
