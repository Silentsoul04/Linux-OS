# Memory-mapped file



## wikipedia [Memory-mapped file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file)

A **memory-mapped file** is a segment of [virtual memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory)[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file#cite_note-:0-1) that has been assigned a direct byte-for-byte correlation with some portion of a file or file-like resource. This resource is typically a file that is physically present on disk, but can also be a device, shared memory object, or other resource that the [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) can reference through a [file descriptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor). Once present, this correlation between the file and the memory space permits applications to treat the mapped portion as if it were primary memory.
