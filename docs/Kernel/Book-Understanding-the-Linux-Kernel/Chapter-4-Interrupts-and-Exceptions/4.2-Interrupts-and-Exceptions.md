# 4.2. Interrupts and Exceptions

The Intel documentation classifies interrupts and exceptions as follows:

## Interrupts:

### Maskable interrupts

All Interrupt Requests (IRQs) issued by **I/O devices** give rise to **maskable interrupts** . A **maskable interrupt** can be in two states: masked or unmasked; a masked interrupt is ignored by the **control unit** as long as it remains masked.

### Nonmaskable interrupts

Only a few critical events (such as hardware failures) give rise to **nonmaskable interrupts**. Nonmaskable interrupts are always recognized by the CPU.

## Exceptions:	

> NOTE: 需要注意的是，Intel将exception分为两类：
>
> - Processor-detected exceptions
> - Programmed exceptions

### Processor-detected exceptions

Generated when the CPU detects an anomalous（异常的） condition while executing an instruction. These are further divided into three groups, depending on the value of the  `eip` register that is saved on the **Kernel Mode stack** when the CPU control unit raises the exception.

#### Faults

Can generally be corrected; once corrected, the program is allowed to restart with no loss of continuity. The saved value of  `eip` is the address of the **instruction** that caused the **fault**, and hence that instruction can be resumed when the **exception handler** terminates. As we'll see in the section "Page Fault Exception Handler" in Chapter 9, resuming the same instruction is necessary whenever the **handler** is able to correct the anomalous condition that caused the exception.

#### Traps

Reported immediately following the execution of the **trapping instruction**; after the kernel returns control to the program, it is allowed to continue its execution with no loss of continuity. The saved value of  `eip` is the address of the instruction that should be executed after the one that caused the trap. A trap is triggered only when there is no need to reexecute the instruction that terminated. The main use of **traps** is for **debugging** purposes. The role of the **interrupt signal** in this case is to notify the debugger that a specific instruction has been executed (for instance, a **breakpoint** has been reached within a program). Once the user has examined the data provided by the debugger, she may ask that execution of the debugged program resume, starting from the next instruction.

#### Aborts

A serious error occurred; the control unit is in trouble, and it may be unable to store in the  `eip` register the precise location of the instruction causing the exception. Aborts are used to report **severe errors**, such as **hardware failures** and invalid or inconsistent values in system tables. The **interrupt signal** sent by the **control unit** is an **emergency signal** used to switch control to the corresponding **abort exception handler**. This handler has no choice but to force the affected process to terminate.



### Programmed exceptions

Occur at the request of the programmer. They are triggered by  `int` or  `int3` instructions; the  `into` (check for overflow) and  `bound` (check on address bound) instructions also give rise to a **programmed exception** when the condition they are checking is not true. **Programmed exceptions** are handled by the **control unit** as **traps**; they are often called ***software interrupts*** . Such exceptions have two common uses: to implement **system calls** and to notify a **debugger** of a specific event (see Chapter 10).





Each interrupt or exception is identified by a number ranging from 0 to 255; Intel calls this 8-bit unsigned number a vector. The vectors of nonmaskable interrupts and exceptions are fixed, while those of maskable interrupts can be altered by programming the **Interrupt Controller** (see the next section).

## 4.2.2. Exceptions

The 80x86 microprocessors issue roughly 20 different exceptions . `[*]` The kernel must provide a dedicated **exception handler** for each exception type. For some exceptions, the CPU control unit also generates a **hardware error code** and pushes it on the **Kernel Mode stack** before starting the **exception handler**.

>`[*]` The exact number depends on the processor model.

The following list gives the vector, the name, the type, and a brief description of the exceptions found in 80x86 processors. Additional information may be found in the Intel technical documentation.

### 0 - "Divide error" (fault)

Raised when a program issues an integer division by 0.

### 1- "Debug" (trap or fault)

Raised when the  `TF` flag of  `eflags` is set (quite useful to implement single-step execution of a debugged program) or when the address of an instruction or operand falls within the range of an active debug register (see the section "Hardware Context" in Chapter 3).

### 3 - "Breakpoint" (trap)

Caused by an  `int3` (breakpoint) instruction (usually inserted by a debugger).

### 4 - "Overflow" (trap)

An  `into` (check for overflow) instruction has been executed while the  OF (overflow) flag of `eflags` is set.
