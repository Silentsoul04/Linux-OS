# passing file descriptor between process

https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/multiprocessing.html

在python的multiprocessing文档中看到了它提出的这个问题：

> forkserver
>
> When the program starts and selects the forkserver start method, a server process is started. From then on, whenever a new process is needed, the parent process connects to the server and requests that it fork a new process. The fork server process is single threaded so it is safe for it to use os.fork(). No unnecessary resources are inherited.
>
>Available on Unix platforms which support passing file descriptors over Unix pipes.
