# [5.5 Stopping and Starting Multi-thread Programs](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Thread-Stops.html#Thread-Stops)

> NOTE: 是在阅读 csdn [线程的查看以及利用gdb调试多线程](https://blog.csdn.net/zhangye3017/article/details/80382496) 发现的这个topic。

There are two modes of controlling execution of your program within the debugger.

| Mode     | Explanation                                                  | Is default |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| all-stop | When any thread in your program stops (for example, at a breakpoint or while being stepped), all other threads in the program are also stopped by gdb. | yes        |
| non-stop | Other threads can continue to run freely while you examine the stopped thread in the debugger. |            |





## [5.5.1 All-Stop Mode](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/All_002dStop-Mode.html#All_002dStop-Mode)

Conversely, whenever you restart the program, all threads start executing. This is true even when single-stepping with commands like step or next.

> NOTE: 上面这段话的意思是：一旦开始program，则所有的thread开始执行，即使是你正在单步调试一个thread，其他的thread依旧在正常执行。

In particular, gdb cannot single-step all threads in lockstep. Since thread scheduling is up to your debugging target’s operating system (not controlled by gdb), other threads may execute more than one statement while the current thread completes a single step. Moreover, in general other threads stop in the middle of a statement, rather than at a clean statement boundary, when the program stops.

> NOTE: gdb能够实现所有thread的 同时停止，但是没有办法保证所有的thread的execution进行控制，这是因为“thread scheduling is up to your debugging target’s operating system (not controlled by gdb)”，比如gdb无法实现下面的这些控制:
>
> - 所有的thread都single-step next
>

On some OSes, you can modify gdb’s default behavior by locking the OS scheduler to allow only a single thread to run.

> NOTE: 在某些情况下，我们仅仅希望一个thread运行，其他的thread都stop，gdb也为user提供了这种power。

### `set scheduler-locking mode`



## [5.5.2 Non-Stop Mode](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Non_002dStop-Mode.html#Non_002dStop-Mode)



## [5.5.3 Background Execution](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Background-Execution.html#Background-Execution)

> NOTE: 非常类似于shell中的做法

gdb’s execution commands have two variants:

| Mode                      | Explanation                                                  | Is default |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| foreground (synchronous)  | gdb waits for the program to report that some thread has stopped before prompting for another command. | yes        |
| background (asynchronous) | gdb immediately gives a command prompt so that you can issue other commands while your program runs. |            |

To specify background execution, add a `&` to the command.

## [5.5.4 Thread-Specific Breakpoints](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Thread_002dSpecific-Breakpoints.html#Thread_002dSpecific-Breakpoints)



```shell
break location thread thread-id
break location thread thread-id if ...
```
