# [5.5 Stopping and Starting Multi-thread Programs](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Thread-Stops.html#Thread-Stops)

> NOTE: 是在阅读 csdn [线程的查看以及利用gdb调试多线程](https://blog.csdn.net/zhangye3017/article/details/80382496) 发现的这个topic。

There are two modes of controlling execution of your program within the debugger.

| Mode     | Explanation                                                  | Is default |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| all-stop | When any thread in your program stops (for example, at a breakpoint or while being stepped), all other threads in the program are also stopped by gdb. | yes        |
| non-stop | Other threads can continue to run freely while you examine the stopped thread in the debugger. |            |





## [5.5.1 All-Stop Mode](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/All_002dStop-Mode.html#All_002dStop-Mode)



## [5.5.3 Background Execution](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Background-Execution.html#Background-Execution)

> NOTE: 非常类似于shell中的做法

## [5.5.4 Thread-Specific Breakpoints](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Thread_002dSpecific-Breakpoints.html#Thread_002dSpecific-Breakpoints)



```shell
break location thread thread-id
break location thread thread-id if ...
```
