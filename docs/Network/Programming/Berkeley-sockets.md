# [Berkeley sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets#Client-server_example_using_TCP)

**Berkeley sockets** is an [application programming interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) (API) for [Internet sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_socket) and [Unix domain sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket), used for [inter-process communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication) (IPC). It is commonly implemented as a [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) of linkable modules. It originated with the [4.2BSD Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Berkeley_Software_Distribution#4.2BSD) operating system, released in 1983.

A socket is an abstract representation ([handle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handle_(computing))) for the local endpoint of a network communication path. The Berkeley sockets API represents it as a [file descriptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor) ([file handle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_handle)) in the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) that provides a common interface for input and output to [streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams) of data.

Berkeley sockets evolved with little modification from a [*de facto* standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto_standard) into a component of the [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) specification. The term **POSIX sockets** is essentially synonymous with *Berkeley sockets*, but they are also known as *BSD sockets*, acknowledging the first implementation in the [Berkeley Software Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution).
