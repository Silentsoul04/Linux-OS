# Executable file format

compiler编译生成的executable ，会按照固定的format来保存，这是本章讨论讨论的问题。

## wikipedia [Comparison of executable file formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_executable_file_formats)

This is a comparison of binary [executable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable) [file formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format) which, once loaded by a suitable executable [loader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loader_(computing)), can be directly executed by the CPU rather than become interpreted by software. In addition to the binary application code, the executables may contain headers and tables with relocation and fixup information as well as various kinds of meta data. Among those formats listed, the ones in most common use are [PE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable) (on [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows)), [ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) (on [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and most other versions of [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix)), [Mach-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach-O) (on [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) and [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS)) and [MZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_MZ_executable) (on [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS)).

> NOTE:As soon as I saw the loader, I thought of a loader in [celery](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html).
